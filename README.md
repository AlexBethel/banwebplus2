beanweb (aka banwebplus)
==========

Make personal class scheduling simpler.

## Example use
The project is currently in use at https://beanweb.us.

## Why?
This project was originally conceived to help [New Mexico Tech](http://www.nmt.edu/) students create a user schedule.
The school's [existing website](https://banweb7.nmt.edu/pls/PROD/hwzkcrof.p_uncgslctcrsoff) is time-consuming to use. Putting together
classes for a schedule was a painstaking process that often took 2-3 hours every semester. Now, it takes 5 minutes.

## Installing
1. Install MySQL, Apache, and git
2. clone project to /some/path/beanweb
3. access /some/path/beanweb in a web browser (may require some amount of Apache configuration)
4. follow the steps necessary to make all statuses successful (green)
